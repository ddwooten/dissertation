\small
It takes a village to make a doctor. I cannot express how grateful I am to
the colleagues, friends, family, and various community members who have
supported me throughout my tenure in graduate school. Without all of your
contributions, this process would have been much more difficult.

Many thanks go to my dissertation committee for their time and effort spent
in improving the quality of this writing. I would like to thank the Exnihilo
team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for all of their help and guidance.
Dr. Steven Hamilton, you have my sincerest gratitude for your help at all
levels of this project, from working through big conceptual questions to
kindly pointing out the smallest of floating point errors. This work would
not have been finished in any sort of timely manner without your generosity.

My colleagues have made Berkeley an amazing place to work and grow. Drs.
Phil Gorman and Katy Huff, thank you for your patience and kindness in
teaching me scientific computing skills when I had none. Dr. Madicken Munk,
my commiserator-in-chief, thank you for seeing me through the most trying
of times and for paving a better-informed \texttt{PATH} than I would have
otherwise traversed. Daniel Wooten, thank you for helping me to say no
to more things. Josh Rehak, thanks for helping me keep it surreal. Ellen
Edwards, thank you for continually inspiring me to challenge myself.

Berkeley Research Computing has been a great source of pride and joy for me
to be a part of. Aaron Culich, I cannot thank you enough for looking at a
graduate student in desperate need of help and seeing the potential for so
much more. I am grateful to the Department of Nuclear Engineering for all of
the free coffee that it has provided.

To my family, thank you for your endless support and encouragement. You have
provided me with an incredible foundation from which I have been fortunate
to pursue any and all of my dreams.

Cathy Berman, thank you for being my personal cheerleader and helping me
grow into myself. Dr. Dillon Shaver, thank you for helping me pass my
screening exams when I really needed it.
Shola Ogunlana, thank you for leading the STRONGER family
to be better versions of ourselves through each and every burpee. Mitch
Crispell, thank you for bringing joy to every single person who steps into
one of your dance classes. Alex Converse, thank you for the love and support
that you have provided, even when it meant bearing with me through a few
periods of crunch time.

Professor Rachel N. Slaybaugh, thank you for advising me in so much more
than just this dissertation work. Your perspective and insights have helped
me to not only bloom as a researcher, but to a grow as a person as well. I
am very fortunate to have had your support in the myriad of endeavors that
I have undertaken in graduate school. Thank you for caring about my well-being
as an individual and broadening my horizons in ways that I never could have
fathomed.
